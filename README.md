# DIY Kata

This repository contains a series of katas I completed for Command Shift bootcamp. I used Jest to write tests for a set of functions and JavaScript to write the corresponding solutions.

It is based on a repository of empty unit tests and empty function definitions cloned from: https://github.com/CommandShiftHQ/diy-kata-3
